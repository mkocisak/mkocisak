# ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matt

I'm an AI executive, builder, and advisor with a background in scientific computing, trading systems, and machine learning. Iâ€™ve led AI and software engineering functions in high-stakes environments and advised investors and operators on how to build smarter systems.

These days, I'm more focused on **what's next** â€” and how to contribute to it.
